## Version 5.1
- Minor Bug Fixes
- Updated Page Titles and Head Metadata

## Version 5.2
- Added Loomians from Halloween 2023 part 1
  - Due to no official odds being released for some event Loomians as of 23/11, I've gone ahead and tried calculating them myself:
    - HW Mistlebud - 1/50
    - HW Cryocub - 1/200
    - Mirriam - 1/50
    - Expect these to change frequently in the coming days
  - Jamiy has mentioned that Metronette & Odoyaga are in their own encounter table (not with the other roamings) while Nevermare & Gargolem are indeed with other roamings. Please keep this in mind when calculating odds for these 4 Loomians. Happy Hunting! ðŸŽƒðŸŽ„

### Version 5.2.1
- Odds for HW Cryocub, HW Mistlbud and Mirrami were officially released (dobby is free!)
  - 1/320, 1/100 and 1/50 respectively
- also slight change to the Halloween Roaming odds: Metronette, HW Akhalos and Odoyaga are indeed in their own encounter table but Nevermare & Gargolem are together in a seperate roaming table too (so they are not with the adventure roamings). 

### Version 5.2.2
- Devtruns released the - more accurate - odds for HW Mistlebud (1.6%) and HW Cryocub (0.3%) so now I'm adding that in (credible source go brrrr)

## Version 5.3
- Zombie Wabalisc has been added
- Renamed some event Loomians to better represent the event/their appearance

### Version 5.3.1
- Bug Fixes
  - Loomians such as Zombie Wabalisc didn't have their Roaming Odds display which meant calculating with roaming charm etc. displayed no result
  - fixed Odoyaga's name (my goofy aah conciously tried avoiding it but still did it anyways)
- Upcoming - fixing alpha odds (real!?)

# Version 6.0
- Happy New Years ðŸ¥³
- 1st wave of Loomians from Jolly Festival have been added
  - Kayute
  - Leopaw
  - Xmas Impkin
  - Xmas Volpup
  - Xmas Nevermare
  - Mimask
- so far, only Nevermare's and Impkin's odds have been released. Those that have not been confirmed are set to 1 and have an asterisk
- Brought back some Loomians that were removed initially due to their existence being obsolete (you can display their base odds now)
  - Rainbow Vari
  - Rainbow Nymaurae
  - Rainbow Goppie
  - Rainbow Pyramind
- Redid gleaming odds to reflect how the game actually calculates alphas and gammas odds (you've been doing it wrong for so long, bozos)
- Sorted the order of Event and Roaming loomians to be chronological
