Version 5.2.1
- Added Loomians from Halloween 2023 part 1
  - Due to no official odds being released for some event Loomians as of 23/11, I've gone ahead and tried calculating them myself:
    - HW Mistlebud - 1/50
    - HW Cryocub - 1/200
    - Mirriam - 1/50
    - Expect these to change frequently in the coming days
  - Jamiy has mentioned that Metronette & Odoyaga are in their own encounter table (not with the other roamings) while Nevermare & Gargolem are indeed with other roamings. Please keep this in mind when calculating odds for these 4 Loomians. Happy Hunting! ðŸŽƒðŸŽ„

Version 5.2.2
- Odds for HW Cryocub, HW Mistlbud and Mirrami were officially released (dobby is free!)
  - 1/320, 1/100 and 1/50 respectively
- also slight change to the Halloween Roaming odds: Metronette, HW Akhalos and Odoyaga are indeed in their own encounter table but Nevermare & Gargolem are together in a seperate roaming table too (so they are not with the adventure roamings). 

Version 5.2.3
- Devtruns released the - more accurate - odds for HW Mistlebud (1.6%) and HW Cryocub (0.3%) so now I'm adding that in (credible source go brrrr)
